It was a normal school day as usual, a cool dry day in the fall. The library in this high school at this time was filled with students and staff. I had no intention to study as I was pretty bad at it, but I still walked into the library since this place gave me a little consolation for not studying even if I was not studying. Hanging around, I pretended to be a part of this silent and nervous environment. And she appeared, a girl, with bunny costume and stunning look, that made this day, and even my life, so different. "Why is she wearing bunny costume in a library? I don't know there are any events held by the drama club right now." I was surprised a bit and wondered, as she went straight to me and said, "Hello," with a volume that was seemingly abrupt in a library. Fortunately no one seemed bothered. She seemed not talking to me, but asking without any expectations for reply. Just for being polite, I said hi to her. She was, however, apparently shocked by my normal reply. "So you can see me then," She said, "I just thought I was gonna disappear from this world forever."
