It was a normal school day as usual, a cool dry day in the fall. The library in this high school at this time was filled with students and staff. I had no intention to study as I was pretty bad at it, but I still walked into the library since this place gave me a little consolation for not studying even if I was not studying. Hanging around, I pretended to be a part of this silent and nervous environment. And she appeared, a girl, with bunny costume and stunning look, that made this day, and even my life, so different. "Why is she wearing bunny costume in a library? I don't know there are any events held by the drama club right now." I was surprised a bit and wondered, as she went straight to me and said, "Hello," with a volume that was seemingly abrupt in a library. Fortunately no one seemed bothered. She seemed not talking to me, but asking without any expectations for reply. Just for being polite, I said hi to her. She was, however, apparently shocked by my normal reply. "So you can see me then," She said, "I just thought I was gonna disappear from this world forever."
I was embarrassed by her unexpected reaction but soon came to myself. I got myself together and then asked, "Why did you say that you gonna disappear from the world?" She suddenly went silent and looked like she was unwilling to continue the conversation for some reason. I was left fidgety on the spot, taking some glimpse at her at short intervals. After a few minutes of silence, she carefully started to tell her secret -- she was under the curse people were gradually forgetting her every night. I could not indeed believe it, but her serious face proved that she was not joking around with me. At that instant, a teardrop trickled down on her cheek. From my perspective, that was not crocodile tears but the evidence that she was really afraid of being removed from the world. From the bottom of my heart, I felt a sense of sympathy started to spring up.
